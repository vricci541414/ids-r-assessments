title: Data Types
description: >-
  We're going to get an overview, of the different types of variables that there
  are in R, and how to work with them.
---

## str

```yaml
type: MultipleChoiceExercise
key: 0e2a0ce37a
lang: r
xp: 50
skills:
  - 1
```

We're going to be using the following dataset for this module. 
Run this code in the console. 

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

Next, use the function `str` to examine the structure of the `murders` object. We can see that this object is a data frame with 51 rows and five columns. 

Which of the following best describes the variables represented in this data frame:

`@possible_answers`
- The 51 states 
- The murder rates for all 50 states and DC 
- The state name, the abbreviation of the state name, the state's region, and the state's population and the total number of murders for 2010.
- `str` shows no relevant information

`@hint`
Check the output that you see when you type `str(murders)`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
library(dslabs)
str(murders) 
```

`@sct`
```{r}
msg1 = "Try again! Read the question again."
msg2 = "Try again! Read the question carefully."
msg3 = "Well done. Proceed to the next exercise"
msg4 = "Try again! Check what the question is asking for"
test_mc(correct = 3, feedback_msgs = c(msg1,msg2,msg3,msg4))
```

## Variable names

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 7455b7cb2b
lang: r
xp: 100
skills:

```

In the previous question, we saw the different variables that are a part of this dataset from the output of the `str()` function. The  function `names()` is specifically designed to extract the column names from a data frame.

`@instructions`
For this question, we will use the `names()` function to extract the column names of the `murders` data frame.
- What are the column names used by the `murders` data frame for the five variables?

`@hint`
Make sure you put the name of the dataset - `murders` - in parentheses after names.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
# Load package and data

library(dslabs)
data(murders)

# Use the function names to extract the variable names 

```

`@solution`
```{r}
# Load package and data

library(dslabs)
data(murders)

# Use the function names to extract the variable names 
names(murders)
```

`@sct`
```{r}
test_error()
test_function("names", incorrect_msg = "Make sure you've put in the name of the dataset.") 
test_output_contains ("names(murders)",times=1,incorrect_msg="Make sure you use the `names` function on the `murders` dataset")
success_msg("Good job!")
```

## Examining Variables

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: efedf86c1b
lang: r
xp: 100
skills:

```

In this module we have learned that every variable has a class. For example, the class can be a *character*, *numeric* or *logical*. The function `class()` can be used to determine the class of an object.

Here we are going to determine the class of one of the variables in the `murders` data frame. To extract variables from a data frame we use `$`, referred to as the accessor.

In the editor we show an example of how to do this. Let`s try it out for ourselves.

`@instructions`
Use the accessor `$` to extract the state abbreviations and assign them to the object `a`.
What is the class of this object?

`@hint`
Remember to assign the state abbreviations to the object `a`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
# To access the population variable from the murders dataset use this code:
p <- murders$population 

# To determine the class of object `p` we use this code:
class(p)

# Use the accessor to extract state abbreviations and assign it to a

# Determine the class of a

```

`@solution`
```{r}

# To access the population variable from the murders dataset use this code:
m <- murders$population 

# To determine the class of object m we use this code:
class(m)

# Use the accessor to extract state abbreviations and assign it to a
a <- murders$abb 

# Determine the class of a
class(a)  
```

`@sct`
```{r}
test_error()
test_object ("a", undefined_msg = "You need to define the object `a`.", incorrect_msg = "Make sure to save the variable `abb` in the object `a`.")
test_function("class",index=2,incorrect_msg = "Keep the sample code when submitting your solution.")
test_function_result("class",index=2,incorrect_msg = "Try again!")
test_student_typed("$", times = 2, not_typed_msg = "Make sure you use the $ accessor.")
success_msg("That's great! Now, you know what the class of `abb` is. Play around to check the class of the other variables in the dataset!")
```

## Multiple ways to access variables

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: daeef502c6
lang: r
xp: 100
skills:

```

An important lesson you should learn early on is that there are multiple ways to do things in R. For example, to generate the first five integers we note that `1:5` and `seq(1,5)` return the same result. 

There are also multiple ways to access variables in a data frame. For example we can use the square brackets `[[`
instead of the accessor `$`. Example code is included in the editor.

If you instead try to access a column with just one bracket, 

```{r}
murders["population"]
```
R returns a subset of the original data frame containing just this column. This new object will be of class `data.frame` rather than a vector. To access the column itself you need to use either the `$` accessor or the double square brackets `[[`.

Parentheses, in contrast, are mainly used alongside functions to indicate what argument the function should be doing something to. For example, when we did `class(p)` in the last question, we wanted the function `class` to do something related to the argument `p`.

This is an example of how R can be a bit idiosyncratic sometimes. It is very common to find it confusing at first.

`@instructions`
- Use the square brackets `[[` to extract the state abbreviations and assign them to the object `b`. 
- Then use the `identical` function to determine if `a`, as defined in the previous exercises, and `b` are the same.

`@hint`
You need to use 2 sets of square brackets.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
a <- murders$abb 
```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
# We extract the population like this:
p <- murders$population

# This is how we do the same with the square brackets:
o <- murders[["population"]] 

# We can confirm these two are the same
identical(o, p)

# Use square brackets to extract `abb` from `murders` and assign it to b

# Check if `a` and `b` are identical 

```

`@solution`
```{r}
# We extract the population like this:
p <- murders$population

# This is how we do the same with the square brackets:
o <- murders[["population"]] 

# We can confirm these two are the same
identical(o, p)

# Use square brackets to extract `abb` from `murders` and assign it to 
b <- murders[["abb"]]

# Check if `a` and `b` are identical 
identical(a,b)
```

`@sct`
```{r}
test_error()
test_object ("b", undefined_msg = "You need to define the object `b`.", incorrect_msg = "Make sure to save the variable `abb` in the object `b`.")
test_function("identical",index=2)
test_student_typed("b<-murders[['abb']]",not_typed_msg = "Make sure to use the double brackets instead of a the $ operator")
success_msg("You've now learned different ways of doing the same thing in R! You're making great progress!")
```

## Factors

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 1f3a027666
lang: r
xp: 100
skills:

```

Using the `str()` command, we saw that the *region* column stores a factor. You can corroborate this by using the `class` command on the *region* column. 

The function `levels` shows us the categories for the factor.

`@instructions`
- For this question we will combine two functions, in a nested way, to determine the number of unique categories.
Use the functions `levels` and `length` to determine the number of regions defined by this dataset and contained in `murders$region`.

`@hint`
Make sure you're using nested functions: `levels` inside of `length`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
# We can see the class of the region variable using class
class(murders$region)

# Determine the number of regions included in this variable 

```

`@solution`
```{r}
# We can see the class of the region variable using class
class(murders$region)

# Determine the number of regions included in this variable 
length(levels(murders$region))

```

`@sct`
```{r}
test_error()
test_output_contains("length(levels(murders$region))", incorrect_msg = "Run the code mentioned in the instructions exactly as is.")
test_function("length")
test_function("levels")
success_msg("Good job!")
```

## Tables

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 50874dd0d0
lang: r
xp: 100
skills:

```

The function `table` takes a vector as input and returns the frequency of each unique element in the vector. (Note that you will see the function `c()` used in our sample code, but we are only using it here to create a vector to which we can apply the `table()` function as an example.)

`@instructions`
We will use the `table` function to answer this question.
- Use the `table` function in one line of code to create a table showing the number of states per region.

`@hint`
Extract the variable *region* from the `murders` dataset using `murders$region`. If you apply the function `table` function to this object it will count the number it times each region appears.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
# The "c" in `c()` is short for "concatenate," which is the action of connecting items into a chain
# The function `c()` connects all of the strings within it into a single vector, which we can assign to `x`
# Here, we are simply using `c()` to generate a vector to which we can apply the `table()` function
x <- c("a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c")
# Here is an example of what the table function does
table(x)

# Write one line of code to show the number of states per region

```

`@solution`
```{r}
# The "c" in `c()` is short for "concatenate," which is the action of connecting items into a chain
# The function `c()` connects all of the strings within it into a single vector, which we can assign to `x`
# Here, we are simply using `c()` to generate a vector to which we can apply the `table()` function
x <- c("a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c")
# Here is an example of what the table function does
table(x)

# Write one line of code to show the number of states per region
table(murders$region)

```

`@sct`
```{r}
test_error()
test_function("table",index=2, incorrect_msg = "Make sure you extract the variable region from the dataset.",not_called_msg = "Keep the sample code.")
test_output_contains("table(murders$region)",incorrect_msg = "Use table on the murders$region variable.")
success_msg("You got this! Now you're a pro at making tables in R!")
```
